<h2>Estimation of Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungi colonisation</h2> 
 

<h3>Estimation of mycorrhizal colonization according to Trouvelot method</h3>

a. Mount 15 root fragments on one slide; prepare two slides (30 root fragments total).
b. Observe these fragments under the microscope and rate according to the range of classes indicated in figure 4 and Annex 1. These classes give a rapid estimation of the level of mycorrhizal colonisation of each root fragment and the abundance of arbuscules.
c. Put the values into the computer program 'Mycocalc' to calculate the parameters: %F, %M, %m, %a and %A, according to Trouvelot et al.. 1986. (see Figure 4 from Trouvelot et al 1986)

Frequency of mycorrhiza in the root system
F% = ( nb of fragments myco/total nb)*100
Intensity of the mycorrhizal colonisation in the root system
M% = (95n5+70n4+30n3+5n2+n1)/(nb total)
where n5 = number of fragments rated 5; n4 = number of fragments 4 etc.
Intensity of the mycorrhizal colonisation in the root fragments
m% = M*(nb total)/(nb myco)
Arbuscule abundance in mycorrhizal parts of root fragments
a% = (100mA3+50mA2+10mA1)/100
where mA3, mA2, mA1 are the % of m, rated A3, A2, A1, respectively, with mA3=((95n5A3+70n4A3+30n3A3+5n2A3+n1A3)/nb myco)*100/m and the same for A2 and A1.
Arbuscule abundance in the root system
A% = a*(M/100)
